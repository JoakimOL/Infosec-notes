# Building
make sure to have installed [`pandoc`](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/blob/master/INSTALL.md) and the [`eisvogel` template](https://github.com/Wandmalfarbe/pandoc-latex-template).
`Make` is also recommended to make building easy, but not required.

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/JoakimOL/Infosec-notes.git
$ cd Infosec-notes
$ make
```

This should produce a pdf called `infosec.pdf`
